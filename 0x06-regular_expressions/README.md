today, i have started 5th month of alx software engineering course. i have been taking shell, c, c++ and python language for four months. but this month, we have started devops. 

i thought we would be learning front end before other programming languages but they said it is after we have completed devops that we will start markup languages, the we will start javascript after we have finished html and css. 

i have been taking html and css online and that is why i couldn't wait to be starting front end from alx. i hope i will finish javascript online on my own when we start js from alx. i am planning 2 weeks for html and css, i need to wrap up what i have been studying and then i will start javascript, then i will go to react, then if i decide to focus my career on backend, i will continue node js and other backend programming languages. untill then, i will focus on front end and i hope i will finish javascript after 2 month and start react after that.
